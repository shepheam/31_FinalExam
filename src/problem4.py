# DONE: 2.
#   In this problem, you will go through the methods of the  Pig  class
#   that is defined below, one by one, in the order that they appear.
#   For each method:
#      (a) Read the method's doc-string (i.e., specification in double-quotes).
#            If you do not understand WHAT the method is to do,
#            ask your instructor to clarify it.
#      (b) Implement the method.
#      (c) Write at least SOME code  in  main  that tests your code.
